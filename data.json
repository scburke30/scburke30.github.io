  "bio": "My work in healthcare started long before I became a nurse. I started out as a nurse's aide at a convent near my town. The nurses there encouraged me to pursue an education in nursing. After that, I worked as a CNA and a CMT at a local nursing home. It was the hardest work I have ever done, but it was worth it. Everyday I miss the connections I made taking care of those residents every day.\n\nWhile I was working full time as a CNA, I pursued my BSN through Missouri Western State University. There I encountered some of the best nurses and educators I have ever met. I graduated with my BSN in December 2023. I was fortunate to land my dream job in a 24-bed mixed ICU.\n\nThe variety of patients is astounding. I care for pulmonary, neuro, cardiac, trauma, post-surgical, and all the patients in between. I manage the care of patients with many medical devices such as Impellas, intra-aortic balloon pump, ventriculostomies, Swan-Ganz catheters, CRRT, and ventilators. I manage the care of critically ill patients requiring ventilators, sedation, and vasoactive medications. I have assisted providers in many procedures such as arterial line insertion, bronchoscopies, intubation, and central line insertion. Additionally, I have spent my time in the ICU expanding my knowledge by obtaining my CCRN and CMC.\n\nOutside of work I enjoy running 5Ks with my grandma, watching Kansas City Chiefs games, and walking my beloved dog, Daisy. However, my favorite activity is watching Hallmark Christmas movies with my boyfriend, Abel.",
